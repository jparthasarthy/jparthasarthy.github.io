# A common failure mode for young founders

[this is a draft if you're looking in git history o.o]

I've started to see patterns when talking to my friends. These people are super sharp, and typically have really high opportunity cost. They can build stuff really well, product, engineer, design, you name it.

But I end up seeing these smart pattern falling into the same pattern:

1. They start a company, but fail to build something that people want. Not realizing when they've failed, they over-invest in a company that's never going to work out.
2. This leads to a learning: *don't overinvest.* They then switch working on different ideas quickly, spending a short amount of time on each. 

However, this idea always didn't completely make sense to me. Because there are a lot of startups that won't work without putting a lot of effort into understanding the specific market or building a great product. There are a ton of companies who took years to launch, or didn't receive traction until they'd been working on the idea for a long time. 

Well, there's sort of a dichotomy going on with start-up ideas. You're basically hoping to find a market (a problem) that's worth solving. So one way to try to find a market is to try a lot of things out. Time-box (as Garry Tan says), and if your idea doesn't work out, kill it and move on. 

Notion took years to get their product to a place where it actually took off. I could imagine if we told Notion founders to "time-box" their idea, they could have given up before they got the product to a place that could satisfy their desired market. Other examples which are similar but not the same include Figma, which took years to launch. How can you time-box that?

Plus, time-boxing is a method you can use to increase your success. It doesn't guarantee anything. You can time-box all you want and switch ideas every four months. In fact, that looks remarkably like what happened to my friends.

*The essential problem: Blue and Green's growth curves are nearly identical before the dotted line. Which one are you?*

So we've landed at a bit of a conundrum. Time-box, and you might quit on an idea that would have worked out with more effort (you stopped working on Green before the dotted line.) Don't time-box and risk wasting your time on an idea that doesn't ever work out (you worked on Blue for a long time.) What to do?

## Enter the "unique insight"

It's a commonly-known fact that great companies are backed by a counter-intuitive, unique insight about the future. Here are some examples:

- People might be okay staying in a stranger's home on vacation instead of a hotel.
- As an industry, sales is moving from outbound-based (reaching out to client) to inbound-based (responding to clients to reach out)
- Speed and responsivity is the most important criteria for lots of users when selecting an &lt;email client | issue tracker | calendar>

You can think of this insight as a one or two sentence summary of a market hypothesis. In my experience, it's really hard for a company to succeed without having a unique insight. It's practically a pre-requisite for success. 

\* Note that you don't have to necessarily have this unique insight the moment that you start the company. Often, you'll develop it while you start the company. You might also have a unique insight that *may potentially* be true, and you're starting the company with the goal to verify it.

Most of my really competent friends had a unique insight in their pockets at all time. A potential reason why is that it's an expectation to have a well-articlulated market hypothesis when you're raising money. Since the ability of your company to raise money is an important thing to monitor in an early-stage company, most founders come up with one.

A funny thing you can do: if you have a friend who's currently raising money, ask them for theirs and watch them turn on their "I'm talking to a VC" mode for 30 seconds. Sometimes, they forget to switch it off.

If you're starting a company and you're a competent person, your unique insight is probably the most important factor in determining whther you're successful or not. Since you can develop this opinion before yo

1. Do you have a unique insight, but you're *not certain* is correct? Then build something to validate it, and time-box. If you can't grow in that time period, then quit.

2. Do you not have a unique insight? Then my suggestion is: don't build anything. Instead, talk to people, understand the market better, and come up with a unique insight. Then, build a product that's intended to validate it.

3.  Do you have a unique insight that you're *absolutely certain* is correct? Are you simply unable to see a vision of the future without it happnening? If you're absolutely certain, then work towards actualizing this vision in lieu of definite positive evidence. So long as you remain flexible enough to change your positiion of definite negative evidence is found, this path seems fine to me.
